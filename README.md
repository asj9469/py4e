I decided to learn Python over my Sophomore winter break. This is a repository that contains all the Python practice exercises I'm doing.

[1/13/24]\
Winter break's over, and I pretty much got down the basics. I am now practicing data structures problems with Python whenever possible.

[2/29/24]\
I took a technical interview in Python (1 Leetcode Easy & 1 Leetcode Medium). I was able to solve both of them early, so I had extra time to talk about my resume & experiences.

[3/5/24]\
Started studying algorithms more in-depth with Grokking Algorithms (added source code files)

[3/15/24]\
Python coding interview succeeded! I got an email that I received "very positive feedback" from my first interview and got invited to the second/final round (behavioral).

[3/20/24]\
It's spring break, and now I can solve some medium problems comfortably. I've been solving leetcode problems pretty consistently, but not all of them are uploaded here. Completed behavioral interview today.

[3/29/24]\
Completed some modules from the Neetcode roadmap. Accepted internship offer (Yahoo Finance 2024 SWE Intern)
