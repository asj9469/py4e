I decided to learn Python over my Sophomore winter break. This is a repository that contains all the Python practice exercises I'm doing.

[1/13/24]\
Winter break's over, and I pretty much got down the basics. I am now practicing data structures problems with Python whenever possible.

Received an email that I was selected for an internship interview! (backend engineering role) - not related to Python but wanted to add it here

[2/29/24]\
I took the interview in Python (1 Leetcode Easy & 1 Leetcode Medium). I was able to solve both of them early, so I had extra time to talk about my resume & experiences.

[3/5/24]\
Started studying algorithms more in-depth with Grokking Algorithms (added source code files)

[3/15/24]\
I got an email that I received "very positive feedback" from my first interview and got invited to the second/final round (behavioral).

[3/20/24]\
It's spring break, and now I can solve some medium problems comfortably. I've been solving leetcode problems pretty consistently, but not all of them are uploaded here.\
Completed phase 2 behavioral interview today, waiting to hear back!

[3/27/24]\
I heard back that I received positive feedback from the behavioral interview (passed final round!). I will be calling the recruiter tomorrow to discuss the offer!!!

Accepted the offer (Yahoo Finance 2024 SWE Intern)
