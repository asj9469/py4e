I decided to learn Python over my Sophomore winter break. This is a repository that contains all the Python practice exercises I'm doing.

[1/13/24]\
Winter break's over, and I pretty much got down the basics. I am now practicing data structures problems with Python whenever possible.

[3/5/24]\
Started studying algorithms more in-depth with Grokking Algorithms (added source code files)

[3/20/24]\
It's spring break, and now I can solve some medium problems comfortably. I've been solving leetcode problems pretty consistently, but not all of them are uploaded here.\
Intensely studied for a coding interview, passed technical interview (coding), completed phase 2 behavioral interview today, waiting to hear back!
